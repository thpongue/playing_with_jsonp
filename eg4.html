		<p>Here we're calling our local object - as with the previous example we change our local json call:
		jsoncallback=processLocalJSON to
		jsoncallback=JSON_CALLBACK

		We can see that the local call doesn't work - JSON_CALLBACK is undefined. This is because angular doesn't really want to call JSON_CALLBACK. It messes about with your request as below:
		</p>
		<code>
    url.replace('JSON_CALLBACK', 'angular.callbacks.' + callbackId),
		</code>
		
		Hence our mocked json needs to make a call to: angular.callbacks._0. Yuck.

		<p>This forces us to cheat by hardcoding our mocks with what angular changes our request to with the ongoing risk that the callbackId will change - and means that angular itself could change in the future and break our tests - by giving angular what it wants (note there are lots of other ways around this)</p>

		<p>Anyway, <a href="eg5.html">this is the working version</a></p>
